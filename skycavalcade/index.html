      <p>
        I wanted to explore the expressive and emotional properties of circuits
        with this project. the circuit is both sculptural and functional and
        responds with its own light and sound to the shadows around it. it uses
        a simple 555 timer circuit as a base unit. six variations of them are
        combined to create different sound and light patterns.

      <p>
        simple elements of the earth (simple truths) remain the most wonderous
        to me still. the same kinds of flows of particles that create shattering
        light and sound explosions in the sky are somehow present in the objects
        we hold and carry every day. somehow we have created our own contained
        versions, like miniature dolls.

      <p>some things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ▒ electrical components can be connected with conductive material of
          ~any~ shape (that set is infinite)
        </li>
        <li>
          ▒ a signal is a signal (whether it is physically interpreted into
          light or sound or other)
        </li>
        <li>
          ▒ small single-function units can express interesting higher order
          patterns when you put a lot of them together
        </li>
