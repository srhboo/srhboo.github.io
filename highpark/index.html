        a couple days before halloween I spent some time in high park recording
        its various sounds, listening to my own sounds moving through it. the
        last time I had been there was before covid started. things were so
        different then, it is a bit painful to behold. still, the leaves were so
        vibrant and the trees remained the same.

        apparently my parents and I lived in an apartment near the park for a
        couple years when I was a baby, before we moved to mississauga and
        before their marriage slowly fell apart. my mom told me she would often
        take me on walks through the park. though I can’t remember it, I think I
        miss being in a stroller—being able to move through the world as not yet
        a person, feeling held, feeling adventurous. we should probably just
        give each other stroller walks at any age.
      </p>

        all sounds and images were recorded in high park on october 28 2020.
