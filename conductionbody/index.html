      <p>
        these wearable pieces act as switches, passing signals to four different
        Arduino pins in order to trigger programmed events during a live
        performance. the signals can be sent by holding either of the hand
        pieces to any of the other pieces (one of the knee pieces has 2 possible
        connections, the rest have 1). the Arduino module then sends the
        readings to Max 8 to trigger changes in sound.

        The placement and features of the wearable parts puts the performer in a
        defamiliarized state in relation to their body, and encourages
        exploration of their new appendages as well as examination of their old
        movements. For this programmed piece, synchronized connections of body
        parts trigger the transition between entirely different sonic
        environments, bringing focus to these moments of unity, and the
        positioning of the body in these transitional states.

      <p>
        Each part was constructed by attaching conductive materials (wire,
        screws) to non-conductive fabric using non-conductive thread, and then
        connecting them to a lead wire and a paired current-limiting 220 ohm
        resistor using conductive thread. I found the easiest method to secure
        the parts onto the fabric was by bending hooks onto the ends of metal
        pieces where possible, to create anchors for sewing.
      </p>
      <p>
        After testing, I found that I would get tiny shocks from having my bare
        skin exposed to the metal pieces, so I added a layer of tape (yes, this
        was after looking up if you could accidentally defibrillate your heart
        with a 3.3 V battery. You can't). I also added some resistors to some of
        the longer circuit sections between the conductive screws, so that
        depending on the point at which the circuit made contact, a different
        effective resistance would vary the current and reading sent to the
        Arduino- in the future, these could be used as analog sensors instead of
        on/off switches.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "receiving" parts (knees, face) were then attached to a PCB using
        their lead wire, where they were soldered to pull-down resistors and
        connected to their respective Arduino analog input pins. The "sending"
        parts (hands) were attached to the positive terminal of the battery
        using their lead wire. I could have just used an Arduino pin to send a
        signal out instead of using a battery, but I was convinced earlier on
        that I could have a wireless glove set up by using the battery (it
        didn't work, of course).
