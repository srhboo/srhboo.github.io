        fragments and notions of chosen home from childhood through to the
        pandemic and beyond, morphing

        sobriety arrived like a friend I thought I had lost forever. to ease the
        strangeness was to rebuild a life, every day. all the rituals that had
        been seeped in rum needed new ones to take their place. and so, new
        midnight friends. to the measured barrier of naltrexone and the sensory
        joys of natto, I am indebted.
