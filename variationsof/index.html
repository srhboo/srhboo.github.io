        generative artworks seem to contain a certain magic because a simple set
        of rules can be the source of infinite expressions. I like that there is
        a lot of play in creating generative art. it lends itself to
        experimentation rather than top-down design.

        it is a gift to be able to surrender to the process and allow the work
        to lead after defining its initial boundaries. then, it's a matter of
        finding a balance of structure (to guide the emerging of patterns), and
        freedom (to allow randomness to give the artwork its own agency).

        digital spaces have largely become flattened and homogenized and
        possessed by corporate spirits. under the towering dopamine-driven
        interfaces of Big Social Media and between loveless cookie-cutter
        business structures, our cyborg hearts attempt to gather but are lost.
        Sol Lewitt's <i>Variations of Incomplete Open Cubes</i> is an early
        generative work that frees the form of a cube by exposing and hiding
        different combinations of its edges.

        how did we get here? if we reexamine the paths we took, disconnect their
        joints and rearrange them in space and time, can we imagine new
        structures? how might we free the web of its current shape, disentangle
        it from the structures of capitalism, and rearrange its parts to allow
        the imaginations of new forms to emerge?

      <p>The rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ▒ 1 - 100 randomly consecutively generated points are created. A point
          must be 1 unit away from the previous point along x, y, or z axis in
          positive or negative direction.
        </li>
        <li>
          ▒ 2 - Lines are drawn at points in the path where the path reverses
          back onto itself (ex. point A to point B, back to point A). The path
          reversal lines hint at where the path will lead, but cannot reveal it
          exactly as there are many path possibilities that can cause each line.
        </li>
        <li>
          ▒ 3 - Planes are created at the points where there are two lines drawn
          consecutively in the same direction. These are places where there has
          been a lot of back and forth movement coinciding with each other: a
          high density of deliberation over which direction the path will take.
        </li>
        <li>
          ▒ 4 – Tunnels are drawn connecting these planes, marking a journey
          through the path’s moments of deliberation and reexamination.
        </li>
      </ul>
